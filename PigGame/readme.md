# Project Name: Pig Game

## Description:
The Pig Game is a simple dice game where two players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points. The goal is to reach a certain number of points before the opponent.


## Features:
- Two players can play the game.
- Players take turns rolling a dice and accumulating points.
- If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends and they lose all the points accumulated in that turn.
- Players can choose to "hold" their points and pass the turn to the opponent.
- The first player to reach a certain number of points (e.g., 100) wins the game.
